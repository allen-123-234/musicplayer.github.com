            Another day has gone
            I'm still all alone
            How could this be?
            You're not here with me
            You never said goodbye
            Someone tell me why
            Did you have to go?
            And leave my world so cold
            Everyday I sit and ask myself
            How did love slip away?
            Something whispers in my ear and says
            That you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though you're far away
            I am here to stay
            But you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though we're far apart
            You're always in my heart
            But you are not alone
            'Lone, 'lone
            Why, 'lone
            Just the other night
            I thought I heard you cry
            Asking me to come
            And hold you in my arms
            I can hear your prayers
            Your burdens I will bear
            But first I need your hand
            Then forever can begin
            Everyday I sit and ask myself
            How did love slip away?
            Something whispers in my ear and says
            That you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though you're far away
            I am here to stay
            But you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though we're far apart
            You're always in my heart
            But you are not alone
            Whisper three words and I'll come running
            And girl you know that I'll be there
            I'll be there
            That you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though you're far away
            I am here to stay
            But you are not alone
            I am here with you
            Though we're far apart
            You're always in my heart
            For you are not alone (You are not alone)
            For I am here with you (I am here with you)
            Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
            I am here to stay (You and me)
            For you are not alone (You're always in my heart)
            For I am here with you
            Though we're far apart
            You're always in my heart
            For you are not alone
            Not alone, oh
            You are not alone
            You are not alone
            Say it again
            You are not alone
            You are not alone
            Not alone, not alone
            If you just reach out for me girl
            In the morning, in the evening
            Not alone, not alone
            You and me
            Not alone
            Oh, together, together
            Gotta stop being alone
            Gotta stop being alone
