            We were both young when I first saw you
            I close my eyes and the flashback starts
            I'm standin' there
            On a balcony in summer air
            See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
            See you make your way through the crowd
            And say, "Hello"
            Little did I know
            That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
            And I was cryin' on the staircase
            Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
            Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            So I sneak out to the garden to see you
            We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
            So close your eyes
            Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
            'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
            But you were everything to me
            I was beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
            Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
            This love is difficult, but it's real
            Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Oh, oh
            I got tired of waiting
            Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
            My faith in you was fading
            When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
            Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
            I keep waiting for you, but you never come
            Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
            He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
            And said, "Marry me, Juliet
            You'll never have to be alone
            I love you and that's all I really know
            I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Oh, oh, oh
            Oh, oh, oh, oh
            'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
