            Where is the moment we needed the most
            You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
            They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
            They tell me your passion's gone away
            And I don't need no carryin' on
            
            You stand in the line just to hit a new low
            You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
            You tell me your life's been way off line
            You're falling to pieces everytime
            And I don't need no carryin' on
            
            Cause you had a bad day
            You're taking one down
            You sing a sad song just to turn it around
            You say you don't know
            You tell me don't lie
            You work at a smile and you go for a ride
            You had a bad day
            The camera don't lie
            You're coming back down and you really don
            't mind
            You had a bad day
            You had a bad day
            
            Well you need a blue sky holiday
            The point is they laugh at what you say
            And I don't need no carryin' on
            
            You had a bad day
            You're taking one down
            You sing a sad song just to turn it around
            You say you don't know
            You tell me don't lie
            You work at a smile and you go for a ride
            You had a bad day
            The camera don't lie
            You're coming back down and you really don
            't mind
            You had a bad day
            
            (Oh.. Holiday..)
            
            Sometimes the system goes on the blink
            And the whole thing turns out wrong
            You might not make it back and you know
            That you could be well oh that strong
            And I'm not wrong
            
            So where is the passion when you need it the
            most
            Oh you and I
            You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
            
            Cause you had a bad day
            You're taking one down
            You sing a sad song just to turn it around
            You say you don't know
            You tell me don't lie
            You work at a smile and you go for a ride
            You had a bad day
            You've seen what you like
            And how does it feel for one more time
            You had a bad day
            You had a bad day
            
            Had a bad day
            Had a bad day
