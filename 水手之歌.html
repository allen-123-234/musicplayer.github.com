            There once was a ship that put to sea
            The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
            The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
            Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            She'd not been two weeks from shore
            When down on her a right whale bore
            The captain called all hands and swore
            He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            Da-da-da-da-da
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
            Before the boat had hit the water
            The whale's tail came up and caught her
            All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
            When she dived down low (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            No line was cut, no whale was freed
            The captain's mind was not of greed
            And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
            She took that ship in tow (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            Da-da-da-da-da
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
            For forty days or even more
            The line went slack then tight once more
            All boats were lost, there were only four
            But still that whale did go (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
            The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
            The Wellerman makes his regular call
            To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
            Soon may the Wellerman come
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
            One day, when the tonguing is done
            We'll take our leave and go
